    <p>CakeQuest is a server side rendered PWA made with Spring Boot. This project creates a place for
      home bakers to centralize all of their favorite recipes by simply pasting in the URL. Recipes are then editable,
      giving bakers the ability to customize a recipe to their own taste. Cake, frosting, and filling recipes can be put together
      as custom Cake Orders. Each Cake Order automatically generates a unified shopping list,
      custom tasks, and a suggested timeline, making big cake projects simple and stress-free.</p>

    <p>Lazztech Noun is a progressive web app designed and developed by Lazztech LLC to facilitate in-person 
      community building. Since June 2025, I have been working full time as an intern for Lazztech LLC.
      In September 2025 I began contributing to this project as an Associate Software Engineer. Since then, 
      I have shipped multiple features and bug fixes in both the frontend and backend codebases,
      created and implemented a UX redesign plan to enhance usability across the app, and optimized 
      performance by implementing Service Worker-based caching.</p>
